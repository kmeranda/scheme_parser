Course Project 3 Report

Rosalyn Tan, Kimberly Forbes, Kelsey Meranda

Relavance: We created a parser for the Scheme programming language, which made use of context-free grammars.

Effort: We all contributed over 7 hours on this project

Content: We created a parser for the Scheme programming language. We worked off a base of code from Kelsey's compilers class. We modified the grammar to recognize the basic syntax of scheme, as well as a few built-in functions such as +, -, *, /, and car.
