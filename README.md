Grammar:
S -> (R)
R -> F A A | Q (B)
F -> + | - | * | /
A -> n | (R)
Q -> car
B -> n | (B) | nB
n = integers

To do:
Store lats into array -- a[0] would be (car lat)
cdr
lat? -- true/false returned as 1/0 instead
atom?
zero?

Optional:
literals
formality of parens in expr
eq?
add functionalities for types other than int
